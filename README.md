 <strong> [Notion CV ](https://www.notion.so/Beatrix-3af240f69b1644cc802ba40d0d01bbd5)</strong>

> <strong>I am a passionate junior frontend developer</strong> working in Seoul , who had been studying fine arts and industrial design for past approximately 17 years. Then, you would like to ask me and wonder <strong>'Why have I chosen to start coding?'</strong>. <br />The origin of my passion in web programming started from when i was 9 years old. When I was 9 years old, I had an experience to build a static website that was about Pokemon collections and through building simple user interactions <strong> I fell in love with the strong satisfaction of actualizing what I planed and give such a service to other people .</strong> <br />The fascinating experience led to me dream of becoming a web develope however only because I have a talent in fine arts, I decided to study deep into the field of Arts until I quit studying Industrial design in the university.<br /> <strong>I couldn't forgot about the days of dream so that finally I am now here to achieve what I have wanted to be.</strong>
